## @d12's Dev Blog

Welcome!

In this blog, I talk about side projects, things I've learned, or anything else I think might be interesting to people involved in tech.

### Where's the Blog?

Check the [issues tab](https://github.com/d12/blog/issues)! Every blog post is an issue. Feel free to use reactions and issue comments to interact with my posts. You can Watch this repo to get notified when I make a new post.
